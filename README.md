# DiscordTokenGenerator
The only DiscordTokenGenerator that works 100%, 1400+ fresh e-mail verified tokens a day.

# Edited by Ewa:
New Features & Improvments
- Got rid of Tempmail.lol (their ip for dns record is blocked by discord & more code take longer to execute)
- Using IMAP (free custom domain, not blocked by discord & faster verification)
- Added external configuration file to setup IMAP
- Fixed Tokens aren't saved in the file after verìfîcation (wasn't saved before if joining a invite failed)
[Note: Some TLDs are blocked by discord (discord won't send a email to them. I noticed it for .monster but there might be more]

# Setup Mail Verification:
- Create a GMAIL Account which is used to forward all Discord Mails to
- Setup 2FA on the GMAIL Account you just made
- Navigate to this Site: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#settings/fwdandpop and enable the IMAP Option
- Add a App Password here: https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/security (Option is only shown if 2FA is enabled) | Set App to Other and choose a random Name)
- Add your Details in the config File.
# Using a Custom Domain:
- Follow the Steps above in Setup Mail Verification and then contine with the Info below
- Register a Account at https://improvmx.com
- Setup the DNS Records the Site provide you with in your Domain's DNS Settings
- Add your Domain Forwarding to * (This forward all mails sent to custom domain to the gmail you just made)

# Proxies
You will have to use HQ Proxies/IPs to get Unlocked Tokens. If you really want to generate proxies, you maight have to spend fairly big amounts of money, to get undetected/unflagged IPs. If you just want to test the Generator, you can also just restart your InternetRouter (if you have a rotating IP) and Discord wont notice.

(Btw your Proxy AD can stand here, DM me for offers ;d ;:D)

Artificial Intelligence
The AI of this bot is not mine and i dont take any credits for it.

It was created by QIN2DIM and can be found here. If you want to update the AI because im late, you will have to grab the files from given repository.

You maight want to regulary update objects.yaml by copy and pasting https://github.com/QIN2DIM/hcaptcha-challenger/blob/main/src/objects.yaml

However, i edited out some code/files, to make DISLOCK lightweighter and to use less imports.

Also, i coded a MouseMovement Generator, to get more realistic MotionData. It uses Interpolation between CaptchaImage-Coordinates to do so.

My Playwright hCaptchaSolver can be easily plugged by replicating check_captcha() in your project.
